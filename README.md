### A rich framework for building applications and services

**hapi** is a simple to use configuration-centric framework with built-in support for input validation, caching, authentication,
and other essential facilities for building web applications and services. **hapi** enables developers to focus on writing reusable
application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure, without getting in the way.

Current version: **6.0.x** ([release notes](https://github.com/spumko/hapi/issues?labels=release+notes&page=1&state=closed)) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/spumko/hapi.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/spumko/hapi)
