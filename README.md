Lead Maintainer: [Eran Hammer](https://github.com/hueniverse)

**hapi** is a simple to use configuration-centric framework with built-in support for input validation, caching,
authentication, and other essential facilities for building web and services applications. **hapi** enables
developers to focus on writing reusable application logic in a highly modular and prescriptive approach. 

Development version: **17.1.x** ([release notes](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues?labels=release+notes&page=1&state=closed))
