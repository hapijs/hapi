A rich framework for building restful API services. **hapi** is a configuration-centric framework in which
authentication requirements, input validation, data caching and pre-fetching, developer documentation,
and other essential facilities are provided out-of-the-box and enabled using simple JSON configuration
objects. **hapi** enables developers to focus on writing reusable business logic instead of spending time
with everything else.

# Usage

## Basic Usage

The following is a simple "hello world" service with a single API endpoint:

```javascript
var Hapi = require('hapi');

// Create a server with a host, port, and options
var server = new Hapi.Server('localhost', 8000);

// Define the route
var hello = {
handler: function (request) {

        request.reply({ greeting: 'hello world' });
    }
};

// Add the route
server.addRoute({
    method : 'GET',
    path : '/hello',
    config : hello
});

// Start the server
server.start();
```

Now navigate to http://localhost:8080/hello and you should receive 'hello world'.

## Server Configuration

**hapi** provides a rich set of configuration options for each server instance:

- [`tls`](#tls)
- [`router`](#router)
- [`payload`](#payload)
- [`ext`](#extensions)
- [`monitor`](#monitor)
- [`authentication`](#authentication)
- [`cache`](#cache)
- [`debug`](#debug)
- [`cors`](#cors)

### TLS

**hapi** creates an HTTP server by default. To create an HTTPS server, include the `tls` object in the server configuration.
The `tls` object is passed unchanged to the node.js HTTPS server and described in the
[node.js HTTPS documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_createserver_options_requestlistener).

```javascript
var Hapi = require('hapi');

// Server options
var options = {
    tls: {
        key: 'your_key',
        cert: 'your_cert'
    }
};

// Create a server with a host, port, and options
var server = new Hapi.Server('localhost', 8000, options);
```

### Router

The `router` option controls how incoming request URIs are matched against the routing table. Router options:
- `isTrailingSlashSensitive` - determines whether the paths '/example' and '/example/' are considered different resources. Defaults to _false_.
- `isCaseSensitive` - determines whether the paths '/example' and '/EXAMPLE' are considered different resources. Defaults to _true_.

### Payload

The `payload` option controls how incoming payloads (request body) are processed. Payload options:
- `maxBytes` - limits the size of incoming payloads to the specified bytes count. Allowing very large payloads may cause the server to run out of memory. Defaults to _1MB_.

### Extensions

**hapi** does not support middleware extensibility as is commonly found in other web frameworks. Instead, **hapi** provides 5 extension hooks for
 any application-specific functionality. Each extension point accepts a single function or an array of functions to be execute at a specified time
during request processing. The required extension function signature is _function (request, next)_ where:
- _'request'_ is the **hapi** request object, and
- _'next'_ is the callback function the method must call upon completion to return control over to the router.

The extension points are:
- `onRequest` - called upon new requests before any router processing. Calls to _request.setUrl()_ will impact how the request is router and can be used for rewrite rules.
- `onPreHandler` - called after request passes validation and body parsing, before the request handler.
- `onPostHandler` - called after the request handler, before sending the response.
- `onPostRoute` - called after the response was sent.
- `onUnknownRoute` - if defined, overrides the default unknown resource (404) error response. The method must send the response manually via _request.raw.res_. Cannot be an array.

For example:
```javascript
var Hapi = require('hapi');

var options = {
    ext: {
        onRequest: onRequest,
        onUnknownRoute: onUnknownRoute
    }
};

// Create server
var http = new Hapi.Server('localhost', 8000, options);

// Set routes
http.addRoute({ method: 'GET', path: '/test', handler: get });

// Start server
http.start();

// Resource handler
function get(request) {

    request.reply({ status: 'ok' });
};

// Path rewrite
function onRequest(request, next) {

    // Change all requests to '/test'
    request.setUrl('/test');
    next();
};

// 404 handler
function onUnknownRoute(request, next) {

    request.raw.res.writeHead(404);
    request.raw.res.end();
    next();
};
```

### Monitor

**hapi** comes with a built-in process monitor for three types of events:
- System and process performance (ops) - CPU, memory, disk, and other metrics.
- Requests logging (request) - framework and application generated logs generated during the lifecycle of each incoming request.
- General events (log) - logging information not bound to a specific request such as system errors, background processing, configuration errors, etc.

The monitor is _off_ by default and can be turned on using the `monitor` server option. To use the default settings, simply set the value to _true_.
To override some or all of the defaults, set `monitor` to an object with the following optional settings:
- `broadcastInterval` - the interval in milliseconds to send collected events to subscribers. _0_ means send immediately. Defaults to _0_.
- `opsInterval` - the interval in miliseconds to sample system and process performance metrics. Minimum is _100ms_. Defaults to _15 seconds_.
- `extendedRequests` - determines if the full request log is sent or only the event summary. Defaults to _false_.
- `subscribers` - an object where each key is a destination and each value an array subscriptions. Subscriptions available are _ops_, _requests_, and _log_. The destination can be a URI or _console_. Defaults to a console subscription to all three.

For example:
```javascript
var options = {
    monitor: {
        subscribers: {
            console: ['ops', 'request', 'log'],
            'http://localhost/logs': ['log']
        }
    }
};
```

### Authentication

The authentication interface is disabled by default and is still experimental.

### Cache

**hapi** provides a built-in caching facility for storing and reusing request responses. The initial implementation uses Redis for its storage needs
(must be manually installed and configured). The cache functionality is _off_ by default. To enable caching, the `cache` option must be set to _true_ or
to an object with custom configuration:
- `engine` - currently must be set to _redis_.
- `host` - the Redis server hostname, defaults to _127.0.0.1_.
- `port` - the Redis server port, defaults to _6379_.

Enabling the server cache only creates the cache interface but does not enable caching for any route, which must be enabled and configured in the
route configuration.

### Debug

To assist in debugging server events related to specific incoming requests, **hapi** includes an optional debug console which is turned _off_ by default.
The debug console is a simple web page in which developers can subscribe to a debug id, and then include that debug id as an extra query parameter in each
request. The server will use WebSocket to stream the subscribed request logs to the web page in real-time. In application using multiple server instances,
only one can enable the debug interface. To enable the debug console, set the `debug` option to _true_ or to an object with custom configuration:
- `websocketPort` - the port used by the WebSocket connection. Defaults to _3000_.
- `debugEndpoint` - the debug console request path added to the server routes. Defaults to _'/debug/console'_.
- `queryKey` - the name or the request query parameter used to mark requests being debugged. Defaults to _debug_.

### CORS

The [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) protocol allows browsers to make cross-origin API calls. This is required
by web application running inside a browser which are loaded from a different domain than the API server. **hapi** provides a general purpose
CORS implementation that sets very liberal restrictions on cross-origin access by default (on by default). CORS options:
- `origin` - override the array of allowed origin servers ('Access-Control-Allow-Origin'). Defaults to any origin _'*'_.
- `maxAge` - number of seconds the browser should cache the CORS response ('Access-Control-Max-Age'). The greater the value, the longer it will take before the browser checks for changes in policy. Defaults to _one day_.
- `headers` - overrid the array of allowed headers ('Access-Control-Allow-Headers'). Defaults to _'Authorization, Content-Type, If-None-Match'_.
- `additionalHeaders` - an array of additional headers to `headers`. Use this to keep the default headers in place.
- `methods` - override the array of allowed methods ('Access-Control-Allow-Methods'). Defaults to _'GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS'_.
- `additionalMethods` - an array of additional methods to `methods`. Use this to keep the default methods in place.

**hapi** will automatically add an _OPTIONS_ handler for every route unless disabled. To disable CORS for the entire server, set the `cors` server option to _false_. To disable CORS support for a single route, set the route _config.cors_ option to _false_.

## Route Configuration

**hapi** was designed to move as much logic as possible from the route handler to the route configuration. The goal is to provide a simple
mechanism for defining routes without having to write code. This approach also enables producing dynamic route documentation without having
to write additional text as the configuration itself serves as a living documentation.

### Configuration options

* `path` - the absolute path or regular expression to match against incoming requests. Path comparison is configured using the server [`router`](#router) option. String paths can include named identifiers prefixed with _':'_ as described in [Path Parameters](#path-parameters).
* `method` - the HTTP method. Typically one of _'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS'_. Any HTTP method is allowed, except for _'HEAD'_. **hapi** does not provide a way to add a route to all methods.
* `handler` - the business logic function called after authentication and validation to generate the response. The function signature is _function (request)_ where _'request'_ is the **hapi** request object. See [Route Handler](#route-hander) for more information.
* `config` - route configuration grouped into a sub-object to allow spliting the routing table from the implementation details of each route. Options include:
  * `description` - route description.
  * `notes` - route notes (string or array of strings).
  * `tags` - route tags (array of strings).
  * `query` - 
  * `schema` - 
  * `payload` - determines how the request payload is processed. Defaults to _'parse'_ if `schema` is present or `method` is _'POST'_ or _'PUT'_, otherwise _'stream'_. Payload processing is configured using the server [`payload`](#payload) option. Options are:
    * _'stream'_ - the incoming request stream is left untouched, leaving it up to the handler to process the request via _'request.raw.req'_.
    * _'raw'_ - the payload is read and stored in _'request.rawBody'_ but not parsed.
    * _'parse'_ - the payload is read and stored in _'request.rawBody'_ and then parsed (JSON or form-encoded) and stored in _'request.payload'_.
  * `auth` - authentication configuration
    * `mode` - 
    * `tos` - 
    * `scope` -
    * `user` - 

### Override Route Defaults

Each configuration option comes with a built-in default. To change these defaults, use the `setRoutesDefaults()` server method.
```javascript
server.setRoutesDefaults({
    cors: false
});
```

### Path Parameters

### Route Handler

### Wildcards

Wildcard declaration in routes are handled the same way as they are in Director or Express. Their retrieval on the handler is handled a little differently.

```js
//when you add a route like this:
server.addRoute({
    path : '/luna/:album',
    method : 'GET',
    handler : albumRetrieve,
    authentication: 'none'
});

function albumRetrieve(request) {
    //hapi.params will have the parameter
    request.reply(albumGet(hapi.params.album));
}
```

## Utilities

hapi provides a myriad of util functions for your use
* `abort(message)` - logs message to console and exits the process.
* `clone(obj)` - clones an object or array
* `getTimeStamp()` - gives a 'now' timestamp
* `hide(object, definition)` - removes hidden keys
* `map(array, key)` - turns an array into an object
* `merge(target, source)` - Merge all the properties of source into target; source wins in conflict
* `unique(array, key)` - removes duplicates from an array
