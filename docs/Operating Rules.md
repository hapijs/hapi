## Operating Rules


### Breaking Changes
Breaking changes that are part of [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) or any module depended on by [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) should have full consensus from the core maintainers. 

### Minor Releases
Minor releases that are backward compatible need strong consensus from core maintainers when it's for [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) or any module depended on by [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi).

### Major Releases
In order to release minor or major versions of [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) and [modules depended on by hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/package.json), consensus is needed by core maintainers.  Consensus in this form means that there aren't strong objections.

### Enhancements and Bug Fixes
Any enhancement or bug fix must be reviewed.  If the code change is to a module that [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) depends on then it should be reviewed by a core maintainer.
